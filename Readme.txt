This is android targeted classic snake game.
 


Instructions
-Switch on the developer mode on your android device by finding and clicking on your developer build number 7 times 
-Switch on the USB debugging 
-Download the Apk file on your android phone.
-Play the game


Requirements: 
-Android kitkat or above 
-Developer mode enabled 
-A carboard holder if needed though the app will give you the idea even without it. 
I do think it would run on most android phones (provided the developer options are enabled) the target device I used is Samsung Galaxy s9+ and it runs fine with the APK installation
